# Identification-of-street-signs

The object of the work is the identification of road signs
For the practical implementation of software modules, the Python language and the Google Colab integrated development environment were chosen. A specific neural network model was chosen. A dataset of ... images was also created to train the model. A software module has been developed and tested.
As a result of the work, an artificial neural network model was trained, tested on a dataset and implemented into a software module. The developed program in the future, with its development, can be implemented into various vehicle management systems and driver assistance systems.
